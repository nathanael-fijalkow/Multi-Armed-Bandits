# Multi-Armed Bandits
This repository contains simple implementations of some algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem.
The main point is to show some plots to compare the algorithms.

Part of the code is inspired by Jaromir Janisch's own code (https://github.com/jaromiru).

Please find the Jupyer notebook [here](MAB.ipynb)
