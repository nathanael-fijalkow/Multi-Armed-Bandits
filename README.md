# Multi-Armed Bandits
This repository contains simple implementations of some algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem.
The main point is to show some plots to compare the algorithms.

Part of the code is inspired by Jaromir Janisch's own code (https://github.com/jaromiru).

Please find the Jupyer notebook [here](MAB.ipynb)

Please find some analysis of the UCB algorithm on a [blog post](https://games-automata-play.github.io/blog/armed_bandits_upper_bound/) of mine.
